    text: "Welcome to The Dharmic Exchange. I am currently a student at Hands on Healing Institute in Tujunga, California working towards my 550-hour California Massage Therapy Council certification. As I continue to learn and master my craft I will be offering highly discounted rates until I graduate. Though currently a student, I have been involved in bodywork for over 15 years. My close relationship with bodywork began when playing football in high school which continued when I earned the opportunity to play collegiate football at Purdue University. Due to the physical stress, constant demand, and injuries I experienced, bodywork cemented itself a vital part of my life. Football is now a past life for me, but as an avid cyclist, outdoorsman, and limit pusher I still stand by the immense physical and emotional benefits bodywork has to offer. I look forward to bringing relief and more fluid movement into the lives of my clients.\_\n\nWith much love and appreciation,\n\nBen\n"
